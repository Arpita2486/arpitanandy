Welcome to my GitHub!

As part of the Rockbuster Stealth project, I worked as a **data analyst** tasked with supporting a global movie rental company transitioning into the online video rental market.

- **SQL Expertise**:  
  Wrote complex SQL queries to:  
  - Identify top and bottom performing movies by revenue  
  - Analyze rental duration trends  
  - Locate high-value customers by geography  
  - Compare sales performance across global regions

- **Data Cleaning & Profiling**:  
  Identified dirty data and applied SQL-based solutions to standardize and summarize key metrics.
